Go Bindings for the Lua C API

Simplest way to install:

$ goinstall -u github.com/xenith-studios/golua
$ cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/xenith-studios/golua
$ make install

In this version of the cgo bindings we build against a copy of the Lua-5.1.4 source that is
included in this distribution. This ensures that regardless of what changes you
make to your system Lua libraries, these bindings will continue to function.
This also ensures that the bindings are cross-platform. (For instance, this ignores differences
between Lua installed via apt on Debian and MacPorts on OS X.)
